trademarks have much less correspondence than patents, so i did not build a folder structure. you may feel otherwise. copy from patents...
note that competitors and confusion are major issues in trademarks, comparable to prior art.

since trademarks have to do with use, i did provide a folder to track use or planned use of the trademark (web pages, brochures, conferences, machines with logo, etc.)
