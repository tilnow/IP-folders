This folder is where you put copies of presentations you prepared about IP or which include an IP slide, etc. It is nice if you also keep a note of comments you received.
Together, this can be a great starting point for preparing the next IP presentation.

this folder is ALSO for storing representations you made about IP, such as "i have great IP" (perhaps in a grant or investment request?) and representations to the FDA and other regulatory bodies which relate what you do to what other people do (e.g., 510(k) predicate devices).
