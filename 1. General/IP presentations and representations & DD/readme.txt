This folder is where you put copies of presentations you prepared about IP or which include an IP slide, etc. It is nice if you also keep a note of comments you received.
Together, this can be a great starting point for preparing the next IP presentation.

this folder is ALSO for storing representations you made about IP, such as "i have great IP" (perhaps in a grant or investment request?) and representations to the FDA and other regulatory bodies which relate what you do to what other people do (e.g., 510(k) predicate devices).

thsi folder shoudl also include presentatiosn made for DD, lists of questions you were asked, what answers you gave and any comments
