each patent family gets its own folder tree. a family usually includes multiple files (each country is a separate file!), that share a common priority or other genesis.

by patent, i include design patents and plant patents

strongly recommended you develop your own internal code for file families and files. example: 
connector.US.2 the connector family, in the US, 2nd filing

you should ALSO always you your provider's reference #.
