# IP folders
A set of folders for a startup to use to manage IP data.

The idea is that a new founder creates this folder set and follows the rules and slowly populates the folders. When the job passes on, the data is organized, making it easier for the next person who handles IP to get to a running start and avoiding institutional memory failure.

Created by Maier Fenster and with input from the rest of the team of medical devices @ Ehrlich & Fenster and various clients and other beta testers. 

The idea of the need for such a folder set slowly grew over many years but was abruptly forced into life by a comment from a client who said "if i was asked what to pass on to new entrepreneurs, it would be my folders for organizing IP". This crystallized the need. 

I am sorry but i cannot guarantee suitability of this folder set for your needs (in fact quite the opposite - it is a generic 20%/80% solution); the folder set does not replace the need for you to understand IP and how it interacts with you business.
